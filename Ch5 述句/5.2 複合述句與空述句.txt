5.2 複合述句與空述句
    Compound and Empty Statements

a statement block combines multiple statements into a single compound statement. 

A statement block is simply a sequence of statements enclosed within curly braces.

Thus, the following lines act as a single statement and can be used anywhere that JavaScript expects a single statement:
{
  x = Math.PI;
  cx = Math.cos(x);
  console.log("cos(π) = " + cx); 
}

注意：
  {} 不用用分號結尾
  縮排只是為了好讀，非必要
  JavaScript 不具有 block scope
  （JavaScript does not have block scope and variables declared within a statement block are not private to the block）

用途
  while loop syntax includes a single statement that serves as the body of the loop. Using a statement block, you can place any number of statements within this single allowed substatement.
  複合述句容許你使用許多述句放在 JavaScript 語法預測為單一述句的地方
  A compound statement allows you to use multiple statements where JavaScript syntax expects a single statement. 


和 複合述句 相反的 空述句
The empty statement is the opposite: it allows you to include no statements where one is expected. The empty statement looks like this:
  ;

The JavaScript interpreter takes no action when it executes an empty statement. The empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. Consider the following for loop (for loops will be covered in §5.5.3):
// Initialize an array a
for(i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0) ;

使用 空述句 的好習慣
for(i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0) /* empty */ ;
