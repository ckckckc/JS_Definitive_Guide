第六章 物件
      Objects

物件：
    是 propertise 的無序集合，每個 property 都有 name value.
    An object is an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value.


JavaScript 物件也能繼承其他物件的特性，這些其他物件就是 prototype。

JavaScript object also inherits the properties of another object, 
known as its “prototype.” 
The methods of an object are typically inherited properties, and this “prototypal inheritance” is a key feature of JavaScript.

JavaScript 中，不是
  字串
  數字
  true
  false
  null
  undefined
的值都是物件，而雖然 string number booleans 並非物件，
他們的行為就像是不可變物件(immutable objects)。


Property 有 name and value ， name 可以是任何字串，包含空字串，但是沒有 Object 有兩個相同 name 的 property。
A property has a name and a value. A property name may be any string, including the empty string, but no object may have two properties with the same name.

每個 property 有一些與其關聯的值，我們稱之為 property attributes:
  The writable attribute specifies whether the value of the property can be set.

  The enumerable attribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a
for/in loop.

  The configurable attribute specifies whether the property can be deleted and
whether its attributes can be altered.

每個物件也有三個相關的 object attributes:
  An object’s prototype is a reference to another object from which properties are inherited.

  An object’s class is a string that categorizes the type of an object.

  An object’s extensible flag specifies (inECMAScript5) whether new properties may be added to the object.

  關於第三點 MDN:
    In ES5, if the argument to this method is not an object (a primitive), then it will cause a TypeError. In ES6, a non-object argument will be treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object, simply return false.

    Object.isExtensible(1);
    // TypeError: 1 is not an object (ES5 code)

    Object.isExtensible(1);
    // false                         (ES6 code)

三個 JavaScript 物件種類
  Native 物件是由 ECMAScript 規格所定義的物件或class
  • A native object is an object or class of objects defined by the ECMAScript specification. Arrays, functions, dates, and regular expressions (for example) are native objects.
  Host 物件是由 host enviroment 內嵌的 interpreter 定義的
  • A host object is an object defined by the host environment(such as a web browser) within which the JavaScript interpreter is embedded. The HTMLElement objects that represent the structure of a web page in client-side JavaScript are host objects. Host objects may also be native objects, as when the host environment defines methods that are normal JavaScript Function objects.
  使用者定義的 物件是 JavaScript 程式碼執行時所創建的任何物件
  • A user-defined object is any object created by the execution of JavaScript code.

兩種 property 種類
  Own property 是在物件上直接定義的特性。
  • An own property is a property defined directly on an object.

  Inherited property 是由物件的prototype 物件所定義的特性
  • An inherited property is a property defined by an object’s prototype object.
