4.11  指定運算式
      Assignment Expressions

JavaScript uses the = operator to assign a value to a variable or property.

i = 0     // Set the variable i to 0.
o.x = 1   // Set the property x of object o to 1.

= 運算子的左側運算元是 lvale: 一個 變數/物件特性(或是陣列元素)

The = operator expects its left-side operand to be an lvalue: a variable or object property (or array element).

可以在同一個運算式中指定並測試一個值
ex:
  (a = b) == 0

= 的優先序很低


The assignment operator has right-to-left associativity, which means that when multiple assignment operators appear in an expression, they are evaluated from right to left.Thus, you can write code like this to assign a single value to multiple variables:

i = j = k = 0; // Initialize 3 variables to 0

指定運算子具有右至左的結合律







I want to be free. I want to leave where I am now. 
I want to fly away like a little bird, leaving all the worries and burdens.
I want to find someone who can love as I am. The end.
