    Function Definition Expressions

 A function definition expression typically consists of the keyword function followed by a comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers (the parameter names) in parentheses and a block of JavaScript code (the function body) in curly braces. 

In a sense, a function definition expression is a “function literal” in the same way that an object initializer is an “object literal.”

// This function returns the square of the value passed to it. 
var square = function(x) { return x * x; }
