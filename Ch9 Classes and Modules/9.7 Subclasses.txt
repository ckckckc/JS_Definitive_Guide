9.7 Subclasses

If a method of B overrides a method of A, the overriding method in B may sometimes want to invoke the overridden method in A: this is called method chaining. 

Similarly, the subclass constructor B() may sometimes need to invoke the superclass constructor A(). This is called constructor chaining. 

Subclasses can themselves have subclasses, and when working with hierar- chies of classes, it can sometimes be useful to define abstract classes. An abstract class is one that defines one or more methods without an implementation. The implemen- tation of these abstract methods is left to the concrete subclasses of the abstract class.
